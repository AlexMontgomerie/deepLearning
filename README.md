# N-HPatches baseline code

The given code gives a baseline for the noisy HPatches dataset (N-HPatches).

[Link to the data](https://imperialcollegelondon.box.com/shared/static/ah40eq7cxpwq4a6l4f62efzdyt8rm3ha.zip)

Patches are 32x32, and each patch has also a noisy version. We will test performance of the descriptor in noisy patches.

Soon we will update the repository with a more detailed explanation (and cleaner code).

INSTRUCTIONS 
--------------------

The script for running the baseline network is given in the file: baseline.ipynb.
The script for running the improved network is given in the file: improved.ipynb.

It is expected that this will be run in the google
colaboratory environment, using the GPU hardware with 
the python 2 kernel. It is important to move the 
following files into the /content folder within the
colaboratory instance: 

 - read_data.py
 - util.py
 - common.py
 - layer.py
 - setup.sh

Once these files are in the correct place, to run 
each network, all that needs to be done is to
execute the run all command in the environment.

The benchmark is automatically run at the end of 
each network.
